# Call Center Survey

**Project Overview**

The objective of the call center analysis project in Power BI is to assess key performance metrics such as call volume, wait times, resolution rates, and customer satisfaction scores. The goal is to uncover opportunities for enhancing operational efficiency and service quality. By utilizing Power BI’s advanced visualization tools, the project aims to deliver actionable insights that can be used to optimize staffing levels, training programs, and customer service processes, ultimately improving overall performance and customer experience.

**Data Source**

**Call Centre Dataset:** This dataset originates from the PwC Switzerland Virtual Internship Program offered by Forage. It contains detailed call records from a customer service center. Each record includes attributes such as Call Id, Agent, Date, Time, Topic, Answered (Yes/No), Resolved, Speed of Answer (in seconds), and Average Talk Duration.

**Tools Used**

- **Power BI:** For creating dashboards and data visualization.

**Data Preparation**

Here’s an overview of the steps taken in the project:

1. **Data Preparation:** Cleaned and organized the data to ensure it was ready for analysis.
2. **Data Modeling:** Structured the data in Power BI for effective analysis.
3. **Data Analysis (DAX):** Used DAX functions to perform detailed numerical analysis.
4. **Data Visualization (Dashboard):** Designed visually compelling dashboards to present complex data in an understandable format.
5. **Insights:** Derived several significant insights from the data.

**Insights**

1. **Topic Distribution:**
   - Payment-related issues are the most common topic, followed by Technical Support and Contract-related queries.
   - Admin Support and Streaming-related issues have lower call volumes compared to other topics.

2. **Resolution Rate:**
   - Contract-related queries, Technical Support, and Payment-related calls exhibit high resolution rates.

3. **Speed of Answer:**
   - The average speed of answer varies across different topics, with some topics receiving quicker responses than others.
   - Admin Support and Contract-related calls tend to have faster response times compared to Technical Support and Payment-related calls.

4. **Agent Performance:**
   - Analyzed individual agent performance based on metrics like average talk duration, resolution rate, and speed of answer.
   - Identified top-performing agents, such as Martha and Diane, for recognition or further training. Highlighted areas for improvement for other agents.

5. **Trend Analysis:**
   - Identified peak hours during the day, specifically at 11, 13, and 17, when call volumes are higher, aiding in optimizing agent scheduling.

6. **Customer Satisfaction:**
   - Examined the relationship between call resolution and customer satisfaction to gain insights into service quality.
   - Monitored unresolved calls and their impact on customer satisfaction, crucial for enhancing the overall customer experience.

7. **Training and Resource Allocation:**
   - Identified topics with higher call volumes or longer average talk durations, indicating areas where additional training or resources might be needed.
   - Optimized agent allocation based on call volumes and topics to improve efficiency and customer service quality.

These insights provide a foundation for further analysis and decision-making aimed at improving customer service operations and boosting overall customer satisfaction.
